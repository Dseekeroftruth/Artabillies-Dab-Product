Artabillies DAB Product Gallery to be on Rstory

In these whimsical and vibrant cartoon illustrations, a distinguished gentleman exudes sophistication and elegance with his classic top hat and monocle. Despite his aristocratic appearance, he engages in an unexpected activity: doing cannabis dabs. 

Holding a gooey dab tool in one hand, with its sticky substance glistening, he is surrounded by a psychedelic aura filled with vibrant, rainbow-filled colors that enhance the surreal and fantastical atmosphere. Adding a humorous twist, a cartoon speech window emerges from his poised lips, asking, “Do you do Dobbs?” The question, delivered in a pompous and sophisticated manner, juxtaposes the gentleman’s upper-class demeanor with the playful and laid-back activity he is partaking in. 

This delightful contrast creates a memorable and captivating visual experience, blending sophistication with a touch of playful absurdity.
